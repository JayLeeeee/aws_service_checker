This resulted in impaired EC2 instances and degraded EBS volume performance for resources in the affected area of the Availability Zone. The overheating was caused by a control system failure that caused multiple, redundant cooling systems to fail in parts of the affected Availability Zone. The chillers were restored at 11:21 PM PDT and temperatures in the affected areas began to return to normal. As temperatures returned to normal, power was restored to the affected instances. By 2:30 AM PDT, the vast majority of instances and volumes had recovered. We have been working to recover the remaining instances and volumes. A small number of remaining instances and volumes are hosted on hardware which was adversely affected by the loss of power. We continue to work to recover all affected instances and volumes. For immediate recovery, we recommend replacing any remaining affected instances or volumes if possible. Some of the affected instances may require action from customers and we will be reaching out to those customers with next steps.<br><br>Additional details are available <a href=\\\"https://aws.amazon.com/message/56489/\\\">here</a>.

A data store used by a subsystem responsible for the configuration of Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks is currently offline and the engineering team are working to restore it. While the investigation into the issue was started immediately, it took us longer to understand the full extent of the issue and determine a path to recovery. We determined that the data store needed to be restored to a point before the issue began. In order to do this restore, we needed to disable writes. Error rates and latencies for the networking-related APIs will continue until the restore has been completed and writes re-enabled. We are working through the recovery process now. With issues like this, it is always difficult to provide an accurate ETA, but we expect to complete the restore process within the next 2 hours and begin to allow API requests to proceed once again. We will continue to keep you updated if that ETA changes. Connectivity to existing instances is not impacted. Also, launch requests that refer to regional objects like subnets that already exist will succeed at this stage, as they do not depend on the affected subsystem.

Starting at 4:07 PM PST, customers began to experience increased error rates and latencies for the network-related APIs in the AP-SOUTHEAST-2 Region. Launches of new EC2 instances also experienced increased failure rates as a result of this issue. Connectivity to existing instances was not affected by this event. We immediately began investigating the root cause and identified that the data store used by the subsystem responsible for the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) regional state was impaired. While the investigation into the issue was started immediately, it took us longer to understand the full extent of the issue and determine a path to recovery. We determined that the data store needed to be restored to a point before the issue began. We began the data store restoration process, which took a few hours and by 10:50 PM PST, we had fully restored the primary node in the affected data store. At this stage, we began to see recovery in instance launches within the AP-SOUTHEAST-2 Region, restoring many customer applications and services to a healthy state. We continued to bring the data store back to a fully operational state and by 11:20 PM PST, all API error rates and latencies had fully recovered.

The issue is affecting the subsystem responsible for updating VPC network configuration and mappings when new instances are launched or Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI) are attached to instances, within the affected Availability Zone. This subsystem makes use of a cell-based architecture, which subdivides the Availability Zone into smaller cells, with each cell being responsible for the VPC network configuration and mappings for a subset of instances within the Availability Zone.\\n\\nAt 9:37 PM PDT on October 8th, a single cell within this subsystem began experiencing elevated failures in updating VPC network configuration and mappings for instances managed by the affected cell. These elevated failures cause network configuration and mappings to be delayed or to fail for new instance launches and attachments of ENIs within the affected cell. The issue can also cause connectivity issues between an affected instance in the affected Availability Zone and newly launched instances within other Availability Zones in the US-EAST-1 Region, since updated VPC network configuration and mappings are not able to be updated within the affected Availability Zone.\\n\\nWe have identified the root cause and have been working to resolve the issue and restore the updating of VPC network configuration and mappings within the affected cell. For instances that are affected by this issue, relaunching the instance within the affected Availability Zone may mitigate the issue. If possible, relaunching the instance in other Availability Zones will mitigate the issue.\\n\\nWe will continue to provide updates as we work towards full resolution.</div><div><span class=\\\"yellowfg\\\">11:11 AM PDT</span>&nbsp;We have taken steps to address the issue affecting network connectivity for some instances in a single Availability Zone (use1-az2) in the US-EAST-1 Region.
